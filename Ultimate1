I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (god damn)

Great, eliminate like ElimiDate (ooh)
Hey, young boy had to penetrate (ooh)
Face, young boy done caught a case (ooh)
Bang, now his mama livin' with the pain (uh)

Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay (huh?)
Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate (oh)
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state (damn)
Denzel Curry is the new candidate (damn)
